# Paper-code
Codes needed to reproduce the figures in papaer "Sustained N2O reduction at acidic pH"
#
For figure S3, codes are available in https://github.com/utguang/RecruitPlotEasy
# For genome construction from metagenomes derived from consortium culture and axenic culture.
nf-core/MAG pipeline was used:  (https://nf-co.re/mag) 
# For amplicon sequencing data analyses.
nf-core/ampliseq pipeline was used: (https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/2.6.1)
# For extracting 16S rRNA sequences from soil metagenome.
Parallel-Meta was used: (http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/parallel-meta.html)
# The Enveomics Tool is available under:




This repository contains the codes used for bioinformatic analysis and viasualization in my manuscript titled: Sustained N2O reduction at acidic pH. Please feel free to reach if bugs occured on these codes.
